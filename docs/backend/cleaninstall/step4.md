# Step 4 - Finish installation & Login WebAdmin

After completing successfully all the steps in the Web Installer, you should proceed to the Login WebAdmin which will let you customize all the options included in your backend. If the installation process was completed successfully, you will receive a message to take you to that panel. After being redirected by that link, you should see a screen like the next one:

{: .text-center }

If Web Installer does not redirect you to the login, enter http://[% DOMAIN %]/login to enter your credentials and start configuring your backend.

To access for the first time, you should type the default username and password :

    Default Username: admin@demo.com
    Default Password: tecmanic

To change the default username and password, you should follow this [article](/docs/backend/how-to/change-default-passwd.html)
