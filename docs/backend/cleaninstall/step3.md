# Step 3 - Setting Database Connection Data

**Note: Make sure you already created the database you are going to configure within the Web Installer.**

1. Enter Database Hostname **(Default: localhost)**
2. Enter Database Username <small> **(You should ask your server administrator for this data and make sure this user was granted all administrative priviledges)** </small>
3. Enter Database Password 
4. Enter the name of the Database you created for GoGrocer

This is an example of the screen where you should enter the information:
![Requirements Verification Screen](/assets/images/backend_installer/step3.jpeg)
{: .text-center }

After completing the information, press next button on the Web Installer. You will see a button like this one.  
![Requirements Verification Screen](/assets/images/backend_installer/step3_verification.jpeg)
{: .text-center }

When you click the button, you may have to wait a little time before the script completes the installation of all tables in the database. In the end, you will receive a confirmation message that the application is properly configured and you can proceed to the last step.
